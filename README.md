unless

you remain here

for about 37 seconds

approximately

but

remember that

i lied

you will remain here for an estimated time of atleast longer than 2 seconds

which isnt much but its weird that you are still here

like wth

who are you

i might know you but i dont know that im talking to you

whats wrong with me

why am i even writing this

this markdown might even just get updated to something stupid again

and it will be lost in my commits

but

i dont want to

i dont want to keep losing markdowns in my commits

it happened already

and it will happen again

after i finish this

this monstrosity

my previous markdown

will also vanish

and so will this one aswell

but looking back

at my previous one

its actually very stupid haha

like "ok" like what 

im not original
