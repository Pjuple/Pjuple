Heya Pjuple here    
Just a question but why and how are you here      
ok lol read the rest of this if you want    

I do stuff but if I do stuff here on github   
Is this even on github    
It is supposed to be but it probably can be found somewhere else    
I probably do but I will probably not let you know since I probably forgot about this readme thing or I'm too lazy to change it    
Just look at my stuff if I have things there    
If I haven't then you're either early or I just haven't done anything here    
Why are you still here?   
Am I like interesting to you?   
Are you enjoying reading this?    
Are you enjoying me?    
cool    
Read on then, there is probably a shit ton of text because I have nothing better to do with my life   
Well actually not tbh, I probably will just give up soon    
I can't just write a complete novel   
unless    
This could be a novel at the end of the day   
Just without the novel aspects    
But how can I like actually put out text that is logically logic that you can rea logically because logically logic things are better to understand than illogical text   
but   
Illogical things are harder to understand, so that will be fun    
You'll have to find out the meaning   
What if I just make some really cryptic sentences   
A bit will have comprehension to read the book of the unknown   
Through the rectangular light, wich is the most logical path to succes, shall be viewed   
idk how to create cryptic things lol    
Lets just stick to normal text since we are normal, right?    
Calling someone normal is hard    
yes   
nothing else    
im not saying anything    
exept for the things I am saying now    
those are said    
But like saying things, is hard   
That's why I rather type text for others to read    
It's more reliable in some ways   
The only reason not is that it is slower, but that gives time to think about what you are saying    
but like who tf thinks lol    
only these people who think   
Wait doesn't everyone think?    
It's like something you can't stop doing    
There are moments when you can zone out but that isn't constantly happening   
Thinking is cool    
Because you think   
cool    
I can't think about things anymore since I just want to get this file to 69 lines   
And idk why, I just have nothing else to do   
Exept for like important things but who cares   
i should probably stop this lol   
But I won't because I wan't that 69   
No one would even know it will be the 69th line   
Will somebody even see this line of text?   
Would all of this be useless?   
Yea ofc it is, I just wan't to do this for no reason    
Hello you reading this whoever you are, a mod checking on this or something, some random guy finding me, someone who knows me that searches me up for some reason   
Hello   
ok    
This file is close to reaching its destination    
I can almost finally stop this abomination    
I'm actually pretty tired from because of this    
This is stupid    
There was no reason for me to do this   
But I still did   
And i can almost touch that line    
This was just an amazing journey of how a file can take a long time to write and to read. A journey without a productive or gaining goal, but just for the sake of stupidity. This isn't the end of a abomination, but of something just amazing. Something you will probably forget and also something you have expirienced. This expirience hasn't helped the earth, nor helped anything. Yet we went through all of this. And this is it. It was long ride with a short end. And that end...   
nice
